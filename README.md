# serialsniffer
serial sniffer with CLI and GUI. Work in progress
This is intended as a middle ground between COM devices and software that talks to them to listen in. It records, saves and shows
the messages exchanged. Currently the CLI is operational however the GUI is still a work in progress, only a testing system right
now. Can be used as a man in the middle or just an endponit if you've got a device that passively sends information without prompting.
